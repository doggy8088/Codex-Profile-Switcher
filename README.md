# Codex Profile Switcher

A macOS menu bar app for switching between local Codex CLI configuration profiles.

It stores profile snapshots in `~/.codex/profile-switcher/profiles` and applies a selected profile by writing it to `~/.codex/config.toml`, then restarting Codex.

This is an unofficial utility. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by OpenAI.

## Install With Homebrew

Recommended install:

```sh
brew tap JakobStadlhuber/codex-profile-switcher https://github.com/JakobStadlhuber/Codex-Profile-Switcher && brew trust JakobStadlhuber/codex-profile-switcher && brew install --cask codex-profile-switcher
```

## Features

- Switch between saved Codex configuration profiles from the menu bar.
- Manage, edit, duplicate, and delete profiles in a SwiftUI window.
- Create a profile from the current `~/.codex/config.toml`.
- Back up `~/.codex/config.toml` before applying a profile.
- Prevent multiple menu bar instances from running at the same time.

## Profiles

Profiles are plain TOML files stored here:

```text
~/.codex/profile-switcher/profiles
```

The filename is used as the display name:

```text
OpenAI Account.toml
Azure OpenAI API.toml
Ollama GLM 5.2 Cloud.toml
```

## Build From Source

Open the project in Xcode and run the `CodexProfileSwitcher` scheme.

From the command line:

```sh
xcodebuild -project "Codex Profile Switcher.xcodeproj" -scheme CodexProfileSwitcher -configuration Debug build
```

## Notes

- Codex is expected at `/Applications/Codex.app`.
- Applying a profile writes to `~/.codex/config.toml`.
- Do not distribute personal profile files, API keys, or generated config backups.
